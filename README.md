# Deep Learning in Portfolio Optimization 📊

## Introduction 📘
This project replicates and reviews the study "Deep-Learning Solution to Portfolio Selection with Serially-Dependent Returns" by Tsang et al. (2020). The focus is on employing deep learning techniques for multi-period portfolio optimization, particularly integrating autoregressive (AR) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models within these methods.

## Project Insights 🔍
- **Objective**: Review and replicate the application of deep learning in solving high-dimensional portfolio optimization problems.
- **Approach**: Employ AR and GARCH models within a deep learning framework to address the complex dynamics of financial markets.
- **Analysis**: Compare our findings with Tsang et al. (2020), focusing on model efficiency and robustness in handling serially-dependent returns.

## Key Components 📁
- **Paper Review (PDF)**: A detailed critique and discussion of Tsang et al.'s methodology and results.
- **Code (Python scripts & Jupyter notebooks)**: Complete codebase for replicating the study's deep learning model.
- **Data**: Dataset used for analysis, highlighting the serial dependency in financial returns.

## Usage 🚀
- Instructions for replicating the study and modifying the deep learning model for further research.

## Conclusions and Future Work 🔮
- Insights on the effectiveness of deep learning in financial portfolio optimization.
- Suggestions for future research directions in the field of mathematical finance.
