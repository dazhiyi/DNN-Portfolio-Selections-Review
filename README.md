# Deep Learning in Portfolio Optimization 📈

## Introduction 📜
This project is based on the study, "Deep-Learning Solution to Portfolio Selection with Serially-Dependent Returns" by Zhiyi Da and Haochen Jiang. It explores the application of deep learning techniques in addressing complex problems in mathematical finance, specifically focusing on multi-period portfolio optimization under Markov decision processes (MDP).

## Problem Statement 🧩
The project aims to tackle the challenges in portfolio optimization, especially in scenarios with high-dimensional and serially-dependent returns. The primary focus is on leveraging autoregressive (AR) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models within a deep learning framework.

## Methodology 🔍
- **Deep Learning Approach:** Utilizing feedforward neural networks, the project develops a deep-learning solution to the MDP problem. This involves creating feedback control functions and employing a minimization strategy.
- **Simulation and Analysis:** The methodology is substantiated with practical numerical examples, employing Monte Carlo simulations to test the model's effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

## Key Findings and Observations 📊
- The proposed deep learning algorithm demonstrates efficiency and robustness in handling up to 100 dimensions.
- Comparative analysis reveals distinct performance variations between multi-period and single-period models.
- The study offers critical insights into the application of the efficient frontier concept in modern portfolio theory.
